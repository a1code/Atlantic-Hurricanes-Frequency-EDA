# Atlantic-Hurricanes-Frequency-EDA  
In this work, we try to explore the frequencies of category 4 as well as category 5 hurricanes observed since 1853 in the Atlantic. The objective is to try multiple approaches to understand trends in the hurricane frequencies, and possibly correlate their distribution to environmental factors.
